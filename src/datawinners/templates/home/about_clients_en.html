                <p>
                    The Government of Madagascar hired HNI for two separate
                    projects using World Bank loans. The first was to create an
                    application for the Ministry of Health to collect stock
                    information for life-saving HIV drugs using SMS from a
                    network of doctors authorized to administer the
                    medications.
                    The second was to work with the National Nutrition Office to collect monthly activity
                    report data using SMS from a large network of community-based nutrition agents.

                    MSI is one of the largest international family planning
                    organizations in the world.
                    <br/>MSI delivers quality family planning and reproductive
                    healthcare to millions of the world's poorest and most
                    vulnerable women. MSI/Madagascar hired HNI for three
                    separate initiatives. The first application collects
                    monthly client data using SMS from a network of private
                    sector doctors grouped together under the brand “Blue
                    Star”. The second collects client satisfaction data using SMS
                    from women who visited clinics affiliated with Marie Stopes
                    International. The third project allows clinics operated by
                    Marie Stopes to submit monthly reports via the Internet.

                    government agencies, universities, foundations, private
                    businesses, and other organizations. HNI and RTI worked
                    together on two different initiatives. The first
                    application allows community-based supervisors to report
                    monthly activity data using SMS. The second application
                    allows RTI employees to submit their supervisory reports
                    and training results using SMS.

                    hired HNI to help build their internal capacity to collect
                    small grants information using SMS. HNI also created a second
                    application that allows National Parks Staff to use SMS to
                    report on illegal activities in any of Madagascar’s
                    protected areas.

                    Ambatovy is a large-tonnage, long-life nickel and cobalt
                    mining enterprise located in Madagascar. It is the
