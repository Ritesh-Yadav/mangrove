            <strong>What is this?</strong><br/>
            <strong>Subjects</strong> are very important. They are the topic of your data collection
            questionnaires. Subjects are often <strong>people</strong> (patients, farmers, children under five)
            or <strong>things</strong> (health clinics, retail shops, water points). Subjects can also be people
            who send you their monthly activity reports.<br/><br/>
            <strong>What do I need to do?</strong><br/>
            Click one of the radio buttons to tell us the subject of your questionnaire. DataWinners will
            provide you the step-by-step instructions for your choice. Donâ€™t worry, you can always decide
            or change your mind later.

            <strong>What is this?</strong><br/>
            Devices are important because you can choose the <strong>communication channel</strong> people will use to
            send you your data. Your choice depends on two questions: 1) How much data do you need to collect
            and 2) what devices do people already have. A good general rule is you can collect answers for
            about 15 questions using SMS. For more extensive data collection needs in the field, we recommend
            using a smart phone with the Android Operating system. If you have regional offices with good
            internet connectivity, you can also create your own online form.<br/><br/>
            <strong>What do I need to do?</strong><br/>
            Choose one, two or all three channels by clicking on the boxes. Don't worry, you can always
            change your mind later.
